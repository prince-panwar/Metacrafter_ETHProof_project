# Zeol Token

## Overview

The myToken project provides a basic implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to mint and burn tokens while keeping track of token balances for different addresses.

## Description

The myToken project is a simple token contract written in Solidity. It includes functionalities to mint and burn tokens, along with maintaining a mapping to track the total supply and token balances for each address. The token is identified by a name, symbol, and an initial total supply of 0.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the Solidity, Truffle, and Ganache extensions in Visual Studio Code (if not already installed).
2. Ensure that you have a compatible version of Solidity installed.

### Downloading the Program

Clone or download the project files from the repository.

### Executing the Program

1. Run Ganache and set up a local Ethereum blockchain.
2. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler in Visual Studio Code.
3. Deploy the contract to your local blockchain using Truffle.
4. Interact with the contract by using the available functions to mint and burn tokens, as well as checking token balances for different addresses.

## Help

If you encounter any issues, please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and extensions installed correctly. Check for error messages during compilation and deployment to identify and troubleshoot any potential problems.
