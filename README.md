Project Title: myToken

Simple Overview of Use/Purpose:
The myToken project aims to provide a simple implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to mint and burn tokens, maintaining a record of token balances for different addresses.

Description:
The myToken project is a basic token contract implementation written in Solidity. It includes functionalities to mint and burn tokens. The token contract keeps track of the total supply and the balance of tokens for each address using a mapping. The token has a name, symbol, and an initial total supply of 0.

Getting Started:

Installing:

Install Solidity, Truffle, and Ganache extensions in Visual Studio Code (if not already installed).
Ensure that you have a compatible version of Solidity installed.
Downloading the Program:

Clone or download the project files from the repository.
Modifications:

No modifications are required for the files or folders.
Executing Program:

Run Ganache:

Open Ganache and set up a local Ethereum blockchain.
Compile and Deploy:

Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract to your local blockchain using Truffle.
Interact with the Contract:

Use the available functions to mint and burn tokens.
Check the token balance for different addresses.
Help:

If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and extensions installed correctly.
Check for error messages during compilation and deployment to identify any potential problems.
